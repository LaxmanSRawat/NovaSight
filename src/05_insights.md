# Conclusion

### Based on Incident Analysis

### Based on Geographical Analysis
* ⁠Brooklyn carries the heaviest 911 workload, while Manhattan handles high volume with relatively efficient response performance.
* ⁠Precinct-level patterns reveal strong internal variation: central Brooklyn, northern Queens, the South Bronx, and uptown Manhattan emerge as consistent hotspots.
* Staten Island records the lowest call volume but experiences structurally slow response times due to distance, coverage, and roadway limitations.
* Potential-crime calls dominate citywide and place disproportionate strain on Brooklyn and Queens.
* Arrival-delay mapping shows that slow precincts are not always high-volume ones. This indicates routing, road networks, and unit distribution strongly shape response speed.
* Temporal patterns are stable and predictable, with mid-year increases and year-end declines.

#### Recommendations
Police departments should 
* Allocate staffing based on incident complexity and delay risk, not just call volume.
* Improve routing and coverage in structurally slow precincts such as Staten Island, Eastern Queens, and Southern Brooklyn.
* Replicate effective deployment models from fast, high-volume areas like Midtown Manhattan, Bronx 44, and Brooklyn 61.
* Adjust staffing schedules to match predictable temporal peaks, particularly summer months.
* Strengthen triage processes for potential-crime calls to reduce operator load in Brooklyn and Queens

### Based on Temporal Analaysis
Crime and potential crime incidents exhibit clear temporal patterns with -
*  highway and location-specific cases requiring significantly longer resolution times (up to 6-8 hours median), 
* most crime categories showing synchronized seasonal peaks during summer/autumn and valleys in winter, and 
* distinct daily rhythms where afternoon to evening hours (15:00-20:00) consistently experience the highest incident volumes across nearly all categories.

#### Recommendations
Police departments should 
* implement dynamic resource allocation strategies that deploy specialized rapid-response units for transit areas (which resolve incidents in under 20 minutes), 
* increase staffing during the 15:00-20:00 peak window and summer months, and 
* develop standardized protocols to reduce the extreme duration outliers (some extending to 11+ days) that indicate breakdowns in case management for complex investigations.
