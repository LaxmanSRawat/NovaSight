# Conclusion

### Based on Incident Analysis

### Based on Geographical Analysis

### Based on Temporal Analaysis
Crime and potential crime incidents exhibit clear temporal patterns with -
*  highway and location-specific cases requiring significantly longer resolution times (up to 6-8 hours median), 
* most crime categories showing synchronized seasonal peaks during summer/autumn and valleys in winter, and 
* distinct daily rhythms where afternoon to evening hours (15:00-20:00) consistently experience the highest incident volumes across nearly all categories.

#### Recommendations
Police departments should 
* implement dynamic resource allocation strategies that deploy specialized rapid-response units for transit areas (which resolve incidents in under 20 minutes), 
* increase staffing during the 15:00-20:00 peak window and summer months, and 
* develop standardized protocols to reduce the extreme duration outliers (some extending to 11+ days) that indicate breakdowns in case management for complex investigations.
