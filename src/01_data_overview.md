# Data Description

Our analysis uses the NYPD Calls for Service (Historic) dataset from NYC Open Data, collected through the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system.

</br>

## Source 

This dataset is downloaded from NYC Open data's <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Calls-for-Service-Historic-/d6zx-ckhd/about_data">NYPD Calls for Service (Historic)</a> catalog item, which represents documents entries made into the NYPD 911 system, ICAD. Each record represents an entry into the system. The data includes entries generated by members of the public as well as self-initiated entries by NYPD Members of Service. The data can be used for issues being responded to by the NYPD. The data includes incident timestamps, location coordinates, radio codes, priority levels, and response unit information.


## Collection Methods 
The data is collected from the ICAD system which call takers and dispatchers use to communicate with callers and the NYPD. The dataset is updated quarterly as part of NYC's transparency initiative

## Attributes used
The actual dataset contains around 48 millions rows and 20 columns, containing records starting from 2018. 

For this project we focused on analysing the <strong> criminal and potential criminal </strong> incident that occured in <strong> 2024. </strong>


Following table represents all the attributes from the dataset along with their description that were used in this project. 

| Column Name | Column Description | Term, Acronym, or Code Definitions | Additional Notes|
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CAD_EVNT_ID | Unique identifier generated by the the ICAD 911 system | | |
| CREATE_DATE | Date of call | | |
| INCIDENT_DATE | Date of incident | | Calls can come in for issues that occurred in the past |
| INCIDENT_TIME | Time of incident | | |
| NYPD_PCT_CD | NYPD precinct call is in | | |
| BORO_NM | Borough call is in | | |
| PATRL_BORO_NM | NYPD patrol Borough call is in | | |
| GEO_CD_X | The X-Coordinate of the midblock of the street segment where the violation was issued | | New York State Plane Coordinate system, Long Island Zone, units feet |
| GEO_CD_Y | The Y-Coordinate of the midblock of the street segment where the violation was issued | | New York State Plane Coordinate system, Long Island Zone, units feet |

| ARRIVD_TS | Timestamp of when the responding unit arrived on the scene | | Not all calls will have an arrival time |
| CLOSNG_TS | Timestamp of when the call was marked closed | | |
| Latitude | The Latitude of the midblock of the street segment where the violation was issued | | WGS84, decimal degrees |
| Longitude | The Longitude of the midblock of the street segment where the violation was issued | | WGS84, decimal degrees |

To extract only incidents related to only criminal (and potential criminal) activities, we manually identified 8 and 11 categories that related to crime and potential crime, respectively, from 488 radio codes belonging to 63 categories. For interested readers, result of this analysis is present in <a href="https://github.com/LaxmanSRawat/NovaSight/blob/main/NYPD_Calls_for_Service_(Historic)_2024_Radio_code_categorization.xlsx" rel="external"> this spreadsheet </a>.Following table shows the these categories -

| Category | Crime Types | Count of Records (2024) |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Crime | ASSAULT, BURGLARY, DISORDERLY, LARCENY, OTHER CRIMES, OTHER-CRIME INCIDENT, ROBBERY| 815,867 |
| Potential Crime | ALARMS, DISPUTE, EXPLOSIVE DEVICE OR THREAT, INVESTIGATE/POSSIBLE CRIME, PANIC ALARM, PO/SECURITY HOLDING SUSPECT, SHOT SPOTTER, SUSP LETTER, SUSP PACKAGE, SUSP SUBSTANCE, SEX OFFENDER HA ADDRESS VERIFY | 1,117,591 |

### Crime Data

```js echo
// Load the parquet file. This returns a promise to an Arrow table.
const crime_data_promise = await FileAttachment("nyc_data_crime.parquet").parquet()
```
```js echo
// Inspect top 10 elements
Inputs.table(crime_data_promise.slice(0,10))
```

### Potential Crime Data

```js echo
// Load the parquet file. This returns a promise to an Arrow table.
const potential_crime_data_promise = await FileAttachment("nyc_data_potential_crime.parquet").parquet()
```
```js echo
// Inspect top 10 elements
Inputs.table(potential_crime_data_promise.slice(0,10))
```
